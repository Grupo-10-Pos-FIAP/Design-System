# Design System

This manual provides common guidelines for all professionals involved in developing, maintaining, and evolving web applications. 
The goal is to ensure a consistent visual identity according to organizational standards, quality patterns, and institutional policies.

The Design System's tokens and icons can be applied across various web and mobile technologies. 
Please consult their respective documentation for specific implementations.

**Version:** {packageJson.version}

## Foundation

Beyond ensuring components meet all established documentation guidelines, this library is built on fundamental principles:

- **Maintainability:** Clean, well-structured, and understandable code that makes it easy to find, modify, and add new featuresâ€”even for developers new to the project.
- **Scalability:** An architecture that supports easy incorporation of new functionalities, support, and components.
- **Accessibility:** Components that ensure navigation via mouse, touch, and screen readers, while meeting design specifications that address other accessibility criteria.

## Library Updates

The library receives frequent updates to add features, improve component design, or fix issues. 
During development, you might notice that components in the layout or Storybook are newer than those in your project.

Since the library is installed via NPM, automatic updates are not recommended (except for bug fixes). 
Developers should ensure they're using the latest version when working with components.

Each project or team should establish documented policies defining who can perform updates, when, and how.

## Best Practices & Recommendations

- **Don't override component styles externally.** Customize components only through their available properties, 
theme changes, or approved library adjustments. External style overrides may break during updates when internal structures change.

- **Always verify component property types and usage.** Each component has documentation listing all properties, 
including required ones. The typing specifies visual and interactive behavior, ensuring components work as expected and reducing issues during updates. 
Even if a component works without a required property in one version, it may fail in future updates.
